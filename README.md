# Linearization-and-Newton-Raphson-Newton-method

Introduction
Nonlinear ODEs are linearized by hand and in MATLAB using the Newton-Raphson method.
Linearization is needed for nonlinear models to analyze a nonlinear function at a single point in a
linear system. Taylor expansion can be used for this.

Conclusion
This assignment was affective in teaching linearization of nonlinear ODEs. Newton-Raphson
method and Taylor series expansion are useful in performing this task.

Discussion
Working out the problems by hand gave a deeper understanding on how linearization works. It is
a way to visualize a complex system such as non-linear ODEs.
